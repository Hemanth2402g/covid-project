Through this dashboard, we aim to provide a frequently updated data visualization, data dissemination and data exploration resource, while linking users to other useful and informative resources.</p>
        <p style="margin-left: 5%;margin-right: 5%;">Caution must be taken when interpreting all data presented, and differences between information products published by WHO, national public health authorities, and other sources using different inclusion criteria and different data cut-off times are to be expected. While steps are taken to ensure accuracy and reliability, all data are subject to continuous verification and change. All counts are subject to variations in case detection, definitions, laboratory testing, vaccination strategy, and reporting strategies. Other important considerations are highlighted under the respective Data Sources below.</p>

            <p style="margin-left: 5%;margin-right: 5%;"><b>Case and death count data</b><br>From the 31 December 2019 to the 21 March 2020, WHO collected the numbers of confirmed COVID-19 cases and deaths through official communications under the International Health Regulations (IHR, 2005), complemented by monitoring the official ministries of health websites and social media accounts. Since 22 March 2020, global data are compiled through WHO region-specific dashboards (see links below), and/or aggregate count data reported to WHO headquarters daily.<br><br>

                Counts primarily reflect laboratory-confirmed cases and deaths, based upon WHO case definitions; although some departures may exist due to local adaptations. Counts include both domestic and repatriated cases. Case detection, definitions, testing strategies, reporting practice, and lag times (e.g. time to case notification, and time to reporting of deaths) differ between countries, territories and areas. These factors, amongst others, influence the counts presented with variable under or overestimation of true case and death counts, and variable delays to reflecting these data at a global level.<br><br>
                
                All data represent date of reporting as opposed to date of symptom onset. All data are subject to continuous verification and may change based on retrospective updates to accurately reflect trends, changes in country case definitions and/or reporting practices. Significant data errors detected or reported to WHO may be corrected at more frequent intervals.</p>
            <p style="margin-left: 5%;margin-right: 5%;"><b>New case and death counts: </b>Counts of new cases and deaths are calculated by subtracting previous cumulative total counts from the current count. These counts are updated incrementally throughout the day as more information becomes available. Daily new case and death counts are complete by 23:59 CET/CEST each day. Due to differences in reporting methods, cut-off times, retrospective data consolidation and reporting delays, the number of new cases may not always reflect daily totals published by individual countries, territories or areas. Due to the recent trend of countries conducting data reconciliation exercises which remove large numbers of cases or deaths from their total counts, such data may reflect as negative numbers in the new cases / new deaths counts as appropriate. This will aid users in identifying when such adjustments occur. When additional details become available that allow the subtractions to be suitably apportioned to previous days, data will be updated accordingly.

                <br><br><b>Time stamps and updates:</b> Time/date stamps reflect when the data was last updated by WHO.
                
                <br><br><b>Other:</b> cases and deaths reported from international conveyances, included in global totals but not reflected in epidemiological curves as not associated with a country or region.</p>
            <p style="margin-left: 5%;margin-right: 5%;"><b>Vaccination data</b><br><br>

                We aim to provide weekly updates on vaccine introduction and administration by countries, territories and areas. These data are pooled from numerous sources, including direct reports from Member States, WHO review of publicly available official data, or data collated and published by third-party sites such as Our World in Data. Data published by third-party sites have not been validated by WHO, and WHO cannot comment on accuracy or completeness. Differences in counts are expected compared to other sources due to different inclusion criteria and data cut-off times.
                
                <br><br>Total administered doses, people vaccinated with at least one dose, and people fully vaccinated are cumulative totals since the start of vaccination in the respective country, through the latest data update. Total administered doses refers to single doses, and may not equal the total number of people vaccinated, depending on the specific dose regime (individuals receive multiple doses). Total doses administered per 100 population may exceed 100, for example when over half of the population receives both required vaccine doses under a two dose regime. Rates -0.001 per 100 population may be rounded to 0. Where multiple vaccines are used in a country/territory/area, the start date displayed is equivalent to start date of the first vaccine introduced. Suspensions (temporary or otherwise) of vaccination rollout are not taken into consideration.
                
                <br><br>The mention of specific companies or of certain manufacturers' vaccine products does not imply that they are endorsed or recommended by the WHO in preference to others of a similar nature that are not mentioned. Apart from limited exceptions, the names of proprietary products are distinguished by initial capital letters.

            <p style="margin-left: 5%;margin-right: 5%;"><b>Interpretation</b><br><br>

                The PHSM Severity Index is not intended for, nor should it be interpreted as, assessing the appropriateness or impact of PHSM responses. COVID-19 PHSM data is collected from publicly available sources from governments, international, national, and regional authorities and media.  
                
                <br><br>Differences between information products published by WHO, public health authorities, and other sources may occur. Start dates of a measure implementation may be delayed, or where unavailable, the announcement date is used. All data are subject to continuous verification and change.  
                
                <br><br>While every effort has been made to ensure the accuracy and reliability of the data through a systematic approach to data-collection, categorization, coding and analysis, and continuous validation exercises, the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and associated data availability is a fast-evolving; therefore, discrepancies are expected. Moreover, the PHSM Severity Index will continue to evolve over the course of the current emergency, as the indicators and methodology will be further refined, improved and adapted to new developments in the countries’ responses to COVID-19. </p>
